Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on the concept of objects and the interactions between them.
In object-oriented programming, data and operations related to a specific object are encapsulated in a unit (object), which can have different attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods).

In Python, everything is an object, even numbers, strings, lists, functions, and so on.
In object-oriented programming in Python, we can define classes that define common patterns among objects.
Then, we can create instances of these classes, which contain specific data and behaviors.

By using object-oriented programming in Python, you can write your code in a more organized and maintainable way.
This paradigm allows you to easily work with objects and their relationships.
