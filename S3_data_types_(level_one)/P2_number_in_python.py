Number Types ðŸ‘‡

1. Integers:
   Integers are defined as whole numbers without decimals. For example:
   
   num1 = 10
   num2 = -5
   

2. Floats:
   Floats include numbers with decimals. For example:
   
   num3 = 3.14
   num4 = -0.5
   

3. Complex Numbers:
   Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part. For example:
   
   num5 = 2 + 3j
   num6 = -1.5 - 2j
   

4. Zero:
   Zero is also defined in Python and can be represented as follows:
   
   zero = 0


These functions are used to convert the type of numbers to each other ðŸ‘‡

"""
In mathematics, numbers can be classified based on the base used to represent them. These bases generally include base-10 (Decimal), base-2 (Binary), base-8 (Octal), and base-16 (Hexadecimal). Here is a detailed explanation of each of these number bases:

1. Base-10 (Decimal):
   - Decimal numbers range from 0 to 9.
   - Decimal representation uses digits from 0 to 9.
   - For example: 123, 456, 789

2. Base-2 (Binary):
   - Binary numbers consist of only 0s and 1s.
   - Binary representation uses digits 0 and 1.
   - For example: 101 (equivalent to decimal number 5)

3. Base-8 (Octal):
   - Octal numbers range from 0 to 7.
   - Octal representation uses digits from 0 to 7.
   - For example: 17 (equivalent to decimal number 15)

4. Base-16 (Hexadecimal):
   - Hexadecimal numbers range from 0 to F (where letters A to F are used as substitutes for numbers greater than 9).
   - Hexadecimal representation uses digits from 0 to F.
   - For example: 1A3 (equivalent to decimal number 419)
