"""
- Expressions in Python are written as mathematical or logical expressions that produce a value.
- Expressions usually include mathematical, logical operators, functions, and variables.
- Expressions are calculations and produce values as output but do not directly affect the flow of program execution.
- Expressions can be assigned to variables, but statements can't.

- For example    result = 3 + 2 * 5

"""

- Statements in Python are written as statements that refer to the assumptions, decisions, and control processes of the code.
- Statements usually include conditional statements (if/else), loops (for/while), function definitions, etc.
- Statements are executed sequentially and have a direct effect on the program execution flow.
- Statements are of two types: simple Statements and conditional Statements
   and conditional Statements are of two types, one-part or multi-part.
- Statements usually start with the keyword and end with : and then the body is written.

- For example ðŸ‘‡
x = 5
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
